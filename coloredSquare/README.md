 <p>This is my Coloring Board and this is how you use it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Left and right side here represent the Colors and Canvas respectively and both are self scrollable panes.</li>
            <li>Select a color by clicking on it and then clicking on the canvas to paint the particular square.</li>
            <li>Click Add color to add new colors and refresh color to to get new set of Random colors.</li>
            <li>Use the '+' and '-' buttons to increase and decrease the size of the canvas.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!! </li>
            <li> Click any where on the screen to get to the Board (once you open the app :) )</li>
        </ol>
